# Personal Website

This repository contains the source for my personal webpage hosted on GitHub Pages.
The site is built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, loaded via CDN so no build
step is required. To preview the site locally simply open `index.html` in a
modern browser. Contact information is hidden behind a button; the email address
contains `REMOVE_THIS` and should be corrected before sending.
